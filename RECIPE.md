#In a saucepan or kettle, add 4 cups of water, 2 inch ginger grated and the crushed cardamom with the peel.
#Boil this water-ginger-cardamom mixture for a good 6-7 minutes, till the color of the water changes to a mild yellowish hue. The ginger releases its juices & flavors in the water and thus the color of the water changes.
#Add 8 teaspoon sugar and simmer for a more of 1-2 minutes.
#Now add 3-4 teaspoon of tea leaves and simmer for about 1 to 2 minutes till the water gets a deep hue of red.
#Simmering makes the tea strong. If you prefer a light version, then just add the tea leaves to the water. Cover and allow the tea leaves to steep in the hot spiced water for 3 to 4 minutes.
#Add ¼-½ cup of hot milk.
#If adding cold milk, then simmer for a minute or two. If using cashew milk or almond milk, then just stir the cashew milk with ginger tea and remove from pan as otherwise heating further would cause the cashew or almond milk to become slimy and separate.
#Strain the tea through a strainer right into the cups.
